# Triangle-tracker

This program prompts the user to enter three sides, then it tells the user whether the sides make a triangle and the type of triangle made.

## Project Description

This application prompts the user to enter three dimemsions of their choice. The application decides whether the dimensions form a triangle by checking with logical conditions specified in the js file. Ultimately, the application alerts the user the type of triangle the dimensions form. The application also stores and outputs the history of inputted items.

## Setup Instructions

To use this tracker do the following:

1. https://github.com/dennis-mwai/Triangle-tracker.git
2. cd Trangle-tracker
3. code .

## Behaviour Driven Development

Input Example: first dimension = 5, second dimension = 5, third dimension = 50

Output Example: The dimensions you have entered do not form a triangle! Enter new dimensions

The program should return this when all dimensions are equal:
Input Example: first dimension = 10, second dimension = 10, third dimension = 10

Output Example: This is an Equilateral triangle

The program should return this when at most two dimensions are equal:
Input Example: first dimension = 46, second dimension = 46, third dimension = 50

Output Example: This is an Isosceles triangle

The program should return this when all dimension are not equal:
Input Example: first dimension = 14, second dimension = 15, third dimension = 16

Output Example: This is an Scalene triangle

The program should return this when you enter strings:
Input Example: first dimension = 6io, second dimension = 15, third dimension = 16
Output Example: The dimensions you have entered do not form a triangle! Enter new dimensions
